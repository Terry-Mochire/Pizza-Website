# Pizza-Website
Practice project to better understand the concepts of  constructors, prototypes, objects, properties, and methods in Javascript as well as using jQuery and DOM manipulation &amp; traversal. This I will do by creating a web application where  customers order different sizes of pizzas with one or more toppings.
